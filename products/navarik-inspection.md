  ## Functional Overview 


  Navarik Inspection™ enables the management of the entire cargo inspection
  lifecycle as follows:

  * An operator/scheduler specifies a nomination through pre-defined templates
  and standardized quality slates (tests and methods), vessels and ports to
  nominate an inspection company.

  * The inspection company receives, accepts and assigns the nomination to an
  inspector who completes the inspection and submits the worksheet, including
  timelog, into the system.

  * Automatic oil loss calculations and cargo quality checks alert personal if
  the quality and/or quantity actuals fall outside an acceptable range.

  * Upon acceptance of the inspection worksheets, invoices are then
  electronically submitted from inspection companies and get checked, approved
  and batched for payment processing.

  * A detailed 4-point oil loss analysis and vessel, cargo and terminal trending
  reports can be generated to help mitigate risk and make better trading
  decisions.
