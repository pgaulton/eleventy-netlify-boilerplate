## About Us 

We were the first software company to recognize the critical need for cargo inspection management in the energy space. Our early focus in this area helped us achieve a dominant market position in one of the most important energy segments, the oil industry. Navarik has since expanded to support other commodities and build a suite of products enabling efficiency across multiple industries.

Our vision is to empower people to work smarter and more effectively. This idea guides our thinking and applies to everything we do. This is reflected in our values:

###### Put the Customer First and Deliver Results!

Making sure we delight our customers and build the best products we can.

###### Have Ownership!

Rise to the occasion and work hard. Be leaders, understand your actions are vital to success.

###### Make Work Fun!

Put energy in, get results out!

###### Don't Seek Glory!

"It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit."

###### Be Transparent and Honest!

Even when it’s difficult, it’s vital to be able to speak candidly with your colleagues. Speaking out is encouraged and welcomed.
