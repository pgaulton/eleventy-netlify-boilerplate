  ## Cloud Native


  As a Cloud Native company, we can stand up your entire infrastructure, we can
  do this because our infrastructure is in code.


  Because most of our code running our SaaS Platform is open source, or will be
  open source in the near future, you have guarantees that you can run our SaaS
  infrastructure anywhere.


  ## On-premise or hybrid cloud


  We've already handled security issues, including locality of data, by enabling
  our platform to run on premise, yet still be managed and maintained remotely.
  We did this by creating a VPN connection between our data center racks and our
  GCP VPC using a cloud VPN and cloud exchange.


  ## Scalable and Open


  We built on top of Kubernetes, Istio, GCP, Kafka, Redis and React to create
  our first Minimum Viable Product (MVP) including a mobile ready website with a
  PWA feature set. .


  ## SaaS architecture worthy of Blue Chip Customers - Kubernetes, Serverless
  and hybrid on-premise with GCP


  Our customers include oil super-majors such as BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and
  Shell, amongst others. They employ Navarik's software to manage the movement
  of oil globally, particularly to manage the process of inspecting cargoes
  during transfer operations. Communication during these complex operations is
  often an issue, so that's why Navarik's lastest product is designed to help
  everyone work together!


  Our users are business users; they have business accounts, use a mixture of
  personal and business devices and are often disconnected and remote. They need
  dynamic, rather than rigid systems to get the job done as unexpected issues
  can and often do arise.


  ## BYOD - bring your own device


  We allow BYOD with Layer 7 security through Istio, Network Level Encryption
  and OpenID Connect Authentication.


  ## Enterprise Authorization


  We support Enterprise Accounts. Enterprises can federate their users and
  enable single-sign-on (SSO). When employees transition between jobs or roles,
  their privileges are controlled by the Enterprise through their company
  account, not through our SaaS platform. However, you can still sign up for a
  personal account to try it out or just to make you a get it done, either way,
  we support both.


  ## Security


  Security starts with knowing who is signing in. We support Multi Factor
  Authentication (MFA) to help ensure accounts remain secure even if there is a
  data breach. We also deal with Authorization in a simple way to ensure we
  transparently reflect permissions to users. This is the first step to ensuring
  people do not end up with elevated rights by mistake.
